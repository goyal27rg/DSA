/* Check if the given Binary Tree is a BST or not
time: O(n), every node visited once
BST follows this property:
    1. All the nodes in the left subtree of a node will be lesser in 
       value (assuming all nodes distinct)
    2. All the nodes in the right subtree of a node will be greater 
       in value

TBD
